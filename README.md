So, this is a simple website that I operated and customized it to be my personal portfolio. This includes:
* Introduction 
* Carousel
* About
* Services
* Portfolio 
* Recommendations

# Introduction 

- This website is customizable for everyone's use, so you can alter the data and add/remove sections the way you want. 
- There are some sections that involve some PHP, and JS not used but just commented. These sections do work properly, but some of them might need some paid features, so I didn't remove them but commented them as optional resources.
This includes but not limited to: 
 * Contact section. 
 * Mail receiving services. 
 * Forms operations. 

# Carousel  
- This was all applied by this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDww4CbxtD4&ab_channel=w3newbie" target="_blank">tutorial</a> from YouTube. Feel free to go there and learn the amazing sliding staff. 
- The Carousel is a full CSS <i>keyframe</i> attribute, which is sliding by %s, again, go watch the video and learn it all. 

# About 

Well, this is only some text and a photo with a background. 
- See, there are amny ways to do this, but, for me, I thought of putting a color background to the image <i>div</i> box. Doing so, made it alterable and responsive in both Desktop/mobile modes. 
- I outlined a button and gave it a CSS-fading-effect, which made it more realistic. This button was for downloading my resume, so you can change it to yours. It also changes its design when hovering. That means I used ":after" and ":hover" attributes. After hovering, faded its background and gave it a boarder, so it appears somehow neat.  

# Services

- Those services were all about <i>div</i> mentioned before. were I gave them an alginment so they appear in segments, as well as making them responsive. 

# Portfolio

This consisted of my prior projects. 
- I have added an additional section (You will find it commented in the Portfolio section) where you can add another category of projects associated with the second category. 
- The categories are connected to each other, so you need to change the JS structure of the buttons coherence. 

# Recommendations

- These are some basic div boxes, which are designed as img sliders. There are some buttons downthere, so you can change between each two testimonial.
